# JDL Symphony Core Implementation TODO

## Progress Tracking

- [x] Initialize project structure and dependencies
- [x] Set up database configuration and models
- [x] Implement domain models (UserProfile, Workspace, Repo, Vault)
- [x] Implement repositories and database layer
- [ ] Implement domain services
- [ ] Implement API routes and schemas
- [ ] Set up testing infrastructure
- [ ] Implement Docker configuration
- [x] Create development commands (Justfile)
- [ ] Run tests and ensure everything works

## Current Status

âœ… **Completed:**
- Created project directory structure
- Set up pyproject.toml with dependencies
- Created Justfile with development commands
- Created docker-compose.yml for PostgreSQL
- Created .env file with configuration
- Created README.md
- Created .gitignore
- Installed all dependencies with `uv sync`
- Created Pydantic settings configuration in `src/symphony/config.py`
- Set up SQLAlchemy async engine in `src/symphony/infrastructure/database/connection.py`
- Initialized Alembic for database migrations
- Created base SQLAlchemy model class
- Created FastAPI main app with health check endpoint
- Tested API endpoints successfully
- **Implemented all domain models with validation logic:**
  - UserProfile with username/email validation and business rules
  - Workspace with type validation and shared resource management
  - Repo with name/path/remote URL validation
  - Vault with name/path validation
- **Created domain exceptions for error handling**
- **Created demo script (`just demo-domain-models`) showcasing domain functionality**
- **Implemented SQLAlchemy ORM models:**
  - UserProfileDB with unique constraints on username/email
  - WorkspaceDB with enum type and JSON fields
  - RepoDB and VaultDB with proper foreign keys
  - All models have proper relationships and cascade deletes
- **Created initial database migration (001_initial_schema.py)**
- **Created demo script (`just demo-database-models`) showing ORM mapping**
- **Added greenlet dependency for async SQLAlchemy**
- **Fixed all linting issues and type annotations**

- **Implemented repository pattern with clean architecture:**
  - Abstract repository interfaces in domain layer
  - Generic base repository with CRUD operations
  - Concrete SQLAlchemy repository implementations
  - Repository-specific methods (get_by_username, count_workspaces, etc.)
  - Unit of Work pattern for transaction management
- **Created demo configuration system:**
  - Added demo_mode flag to settings
  - Created get_demo_settings() helper
  - Demos use in-memory SQLite database
  - Complete isolation from production database
- **Created demo script (`just demo-repositories`) showcasing repository pattern**
- **Fixed all linting and type checking issues**

ðŸš§ **Next Steps:**
1. Implement domain services (Commit 6)
2. Create API schemas and routes
3. Set up testing infrastructure

## Notes

- Using two-level aggregate design: UserProfile (global) and Workspace (independent contexts)
- Following clean architecture with clear separation between domain, infrastructure, and application layers
- All database operations should be async using asyncpg/SQLAlchemy async
