# JDL Symphony Core Implementation TODO

## Progress Tracking

- [x] Initialize project structure and dependencies
- [x] Set up database configuration and models
- [ ] Implement domain models (UserProfile, Workspace, Repo, Vault)
- [ ] Implement repositories and database layer
- [ ] Implement domain services
- [ ] Implement API routes and schemas
- [ ] Set up testing infrastructure
- [ ] Implement Docker configuration
- [ ] Create development commands (Justfile)
- [ ] Run tests and ensure everything works

## Current Status

âœ… **Completed:**
- Created project directory structure
- Set up pyproject.toml with dependencies
- Created Justfile with development commands
- Created docker-compose.yml for PostgreSQL
- Created .env file with configuration
- Created README.md
- Created .gitignore
- Installed all dependencies with `uv sync`
- Created Pydantic settings configuration in `src/symphony/config.py`
- Set up SQLAlchemy async engine in `src/symphony/infrastructure/database/connection.py`
- Initialized Alembic for database migrations
- Created base SQLAlchemy model class
- Created FastAPI main app with health check endpoint
- Tested API endpoints successfully

ðŸš§ **Next Steps:**
1. Create domain models (UserProfile, Workspace, Repo, Vault)
2. Create SQLAlchemy ORM models
3. Generate initial database migration
4. Implement repository interfaces and concrete implementations
5. Create API schemas and routes

## Notes

- Using two-level aggregate design: UserProfile (global) and Workspace (independent contexts)
- Following clean architecture with clear separation between domain, infrastructure, and application layers
- All database operations should be async using asyncpg/SQLAlchemy async
