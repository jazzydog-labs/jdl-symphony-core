#### Commit 2: Database Configuration & Connection
- Pydantic settings configuration (`config.py`)
- SQLAlchemy async engine setup
- Database connection management
- Alembic migration setup
- Health check endpoint

#### Commit 3: Domain Models
- Pure Python domain entities (UserProfile, Workspace, Repo, Vault)
- Domain validation logic
- Business rules implementation
- Value objects and domain exceptions

### Phase 2: Data Layer (Commits 4-5)
**Goal:** Implement persistence layer with repository pattern

#### Commit 4: Database Models & Migrations
- SQLAlchemy ORM models
- Initial database schema migration
- Indexes and constraints
- Base repository implementation

#### Commit 5: Repository Implementations
- Abstract repository interfaces
- Concrete async repository implementations
- Unit of Work pattern
- Basic CRUD operations for all entities

### Phase 3: Business Logic (Commits 6-7)
**Goal:** Implement domain services and application layer

#### Commit 6: Domain Services
- UserProfileService with business logic
- WorkspaceService with cross-aggregate coordination
- Error handling and domain exceptions
- Service-level validation

#### Commit 7: Application Layer (CQRS)
- Command handlers for write operations
- Query handlers for read operations
- Application-level DTOs
- Use case orchestration

### Phase 4: API Layer (Commits 8-9)
**Goal:** Expose functionality through RESTful API

#### Commit 8: API Schemas & Routes Setup
- Pydantic request/response schemas
- FastAPI dependency injection setup
- Route organization and structure
- OpenAPI documentation

#### Commit 9: Complete API Implementation
- All CRUD endpoints for each aggregate
- Proper error handling and status codes
- Request validation
- API versioning structure

### Phase 5: Testing & Quality (Commits 10-11)
**Goal:** Comprehensive test coverage and quality assurance

#### Commit 10: Testing Infrastructure
- Pytest fixtures and configuration
- Test database setup
- Mock factories
- Integration test helpers

#### Commit 11: Test Implementation
- Unit tests for domain logic
- Repository integration tests
- API endpoint tests
- End-to-end scenarios

### Phase 6: Production Readiness (Commits 12-13)
**Goal:** Prepare for deployment

#### Commit 12: Docker & Deployment
- Multi-stage Dockerfile with Chainguard
- Production configuration
- Environment-specific settings
- Container security scanning

#### Commit 13: Documentation & Final Polish
- API documentation
- Development guide
- Deployment instructions
- Performance optimizations

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Two-Level Aggregate Design
- **UserProfile**: Global user data, acts as identity anchor
- **Workspace**: Independent work contexts with full autonomy
- Clear boundaries enable independent scaling and development

### 2. Clean Architecture Layers
```
├── Domain Layer (Pure business logic)
│   ├── Models (Entities, Value Objects)
│   ├── Repositories (Interfaces)
│   └── Services (Domain logic)
├── Application Layer (Use cases)
│   ├── Commands (Write operations)
│   └── Queries (Read operations)
└── Infrastructure Layer (External concerns)
    ├── Database (PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy)
    └── API (FastAPI, HTTP)
```

### 3. Async-First Approach
- All database operations use async/await
- SQLAlchemy 2.0 async sessions
- FastAPI async route handlers
- Asyncpg for PostgreSQL connections

### 4. Repository Pattern Benefits
- Decouples domain from persistence
- Enables easy testing with mocks
- Supports future changes (e.g., different databases)
- Clear separation of concerns

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (60% coverage target)
- Domain model methods and validation
- Service business logic
- Command/Query handlers

### Integration Tests (30% coverage target)
- Repository operations with real database
- API endpoints with test client
- Cross-layer workflows

### E2E Tests (10% coverage target)
- Complete user scenarios
- Multi-aggregate operations
- Error handling paths

## Development Workflow

1. **For each commit:**
   - Implement features incrementally
   - Write tests alongside code
   - Run linting and type checking
   - Ensure all tests pass
   - Create descriptive commit message

2. **Quality checks before commit:**
   ```bash
   just lint
   just typecheck
   just test
   ```

3. **Database changes:**
   ```bash
   just db-up
   just db-revision "description"
   just db-migrate
   ```

## Success Metrics

1. **Clean Architecture Adherence**
   - No infrastructure imports in domain layer
   - Clear dependency direction (inward)
   - Testable business logic

2. **Code Quality**
   - Type hints on all functions
   - Ruff linting passes
   - Pyright strict mode passes
   - 80%+ test coverage

3. **API Design**
   - RESTful conventions
   - Consistent error responses
   - Comprehensive OpenAPI docs
   - Sub-second response times

4. **Developer Experience**
   - Setup in < 30 minutes
   - Single command to run (`just run`)
   - Clear error messages
   - Helpful documentation

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Scope Creep**
   - Stick to Phase 0 requirements
   - Defer advanced features
   - Focus on core CRUD operations

2. **Technical Debt**
   - Regular refactoring
   - Maintain test coverage
   - Document decisions

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Use async operations
   - Implement proper indexes
   - Profile critical paths

## Next Steps After Phase 0

The architecture is designed to support:
- Authentication/authorization middleware
- Event sourcing for audit trails
- WebSocket support for real-time updates
- File system integration for repos/vaults
- Advanced querying with filters/pagination
- Caching layer for performance
- Message queue for async operations

This plan ensures a solid foundation while maintaining flexibility for future enhancements.
