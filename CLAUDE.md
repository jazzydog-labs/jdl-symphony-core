Follow the instructions in backend_spec.md to initialize the repo.

Make sure all the just commands run and the tests pass.

# Before starting implementation
Please check all the things you have to do, and before you start doing them check that you have the relevant permissins (e.g. write, git, just, etc) to run your commands by attempting to create tmp files in this directory, and then cleaning them up.

## Implementation Progress

Track progress in `jdl-symphony-core/todo.md`
See high-level implementation plan in `jdl-symphony-core/project-plan.md`

Current status: Database configuration and FastAPI foundation completed (Commit 2). Next step is to implement domain models (UserProfile, Workspace, Repo, Vault).

When resuming work:
1. Check todo.md for current progress
2. Review project-plan.md for implementation strategy
3. Continue from the next uncompleted task
4. Make commits at each major milestone (as outlined in project plan)
5. Ensure tests pass before each commit
